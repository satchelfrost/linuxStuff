# First make sure that rsync is installed on both machines
sudo -s

# Next login as root on the host machine and go into roots home directory and run the following
ssh-keygen

# Next secure copy the public key over to the server
scp /root/.ssh/publickey.pub user@ipOfServer:/some/directory

# Then login as root on the server and place the public key in /root
# Next make a directory if one dies not exist for .ssh and give it 700 permissions
mkdir -p /root/.ssh
chmod 700
touch /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys

# Finally, cat the key in the authorized_keys
cat /root/publickey.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Back on the host machin create a script, e.g. backup.sh
rsync -avz root@ip:/home/satchelfrost/folderToBackupOnServer /home/reese/BackupFolderOnHost

# Note use --delete if you want it to be a mirror
rsync -avz --delete root@ip:/home/satchelfrost/folderToBackupOnServer /home/reese/BackupFolderOnHost

# Next edit crontab as root
crontab -e

# If not root then use sudo
sudo crontab -e

# Edit the schedule and give it the path to the script
# e.g. every minute backup
* * * * * /full/path/to/script.sh
